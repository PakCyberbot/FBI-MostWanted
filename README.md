# FBI-MostWanted Python tool
An open-source tool that gets information on the FBI Wanted program, this includes lists of wanted criminals, unidentified victims, etc. 

This tool is an enhanced version of the previous one written by @rly0nheart. Thanks to him for making my work more easier by creating fbi-api handling python library.

 Please check the **"Improvements"** section below to learn about the new features.

# Improvements
## version 2
* You now have the capability to **download PDF files for each entry/record** on the wanted list, whereas before, you were limited to downloading a single PDF file for an individual person.
* If you provide a **dump file with a PDF extension, the tool will automatically enter download mode and proceed to download the PDF files** of all wanted individuals. The downloaded files will be saved in the directory with the same name as the provided dump file.
* You can now fetch any **desired number of records from the wanted list using the "--records" option**.
* Additionally, you have the capability to **download each image file separately using --images**. The downloaded image files will be stored in the "wanted-images" directory for OSINT purposes.
* By including the "--reward" option, **you can easily filter out records that include a reward**. If you specify the "--records" parameter along with it, be aware that the filter will be applied to the available entries, potentially resulting in a count lower than the specified "--records" value.
* Implemented an update feature allowing users to easily update the program to the latest version using the **-u** or **--update** option.
## version 3
* **Added Rich library for enhanced program interaction** 
* Added support for **dumping files in HTML format** using the **--dump** option. Simply provide the desired filename with the **.html** extension.
* Supports **multithreading** to speed the download process (v3.1.0)
